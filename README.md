# hello-world
This is the first pass o nthe readme file. I'm looking to make changes and commit this (save) this to the main branch. 
There might be some typos....but I don't care....timestamp: May 27, 2021 0931 EST


Ok, now i'm following allong with the guide....

my plan is to "save" this branch to the main...which is actually called a pull request.
In full github terminology, I made some commit changes and will not open a pull request to merge the commit/changes.
